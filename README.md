Extremely exciting field of Computer Science, with extremely hard tasks to solve - a light at the end of the tunnel when other approaches fails. 

I am really proud of solutions, some of them took me weeks to figure out, that's why are open to the public :)

That was also my favorite course during the university so it carries also some nostalgia within.
